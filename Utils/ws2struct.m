%This Script saves all the variables from the current workspace into a 
%single structure array.

%Summary:
%This function allows to save all the variables from the 'caller' workspace into a struct array
%Description:
%Sometimes you need to save the variables from your base workspace, but using "save" function will have them all stored individually so if you reload them into a new workspace it could be a mess, and some variables could be overwritten.
%With this function, you can save all of them into a struct array, and so they'll be nicely packaged and ready to be saved to a .mat file that, when reloaded, will be easy to identify. 
%Tags:
%save, struct, base, workspace, structure array
%Example:
% a='LALALA'
% b=[1:12:258]
% c={'cell1', 'cell2', 'cell3'}
% d=768
% e=true(3)
% theworkspace=ws2struct();
% theworkspace = 
% 
%     a: 'LALALA'
%     b: [1x22 double]
%     c: {'cell1'  'cell2'  'cell3'}
%     d: 768
%     e: [3x3 logical]
