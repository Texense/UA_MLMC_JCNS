This repository contains the source code accompanying the
paper "Multilevel Monte Carlo for Cortical Circuit Models,"
to appear in the Journal of Computational Neuroscience.

We are currently working to organize and document the code.
Eventually, this file will contain instructions on how to

- reproduce the figures in our paper

- implement MLMC for your own project using this code

Meanwhile, if you have any questions, please contact one of
us.
